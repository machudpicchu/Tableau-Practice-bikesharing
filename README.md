# Citibike Bikesharing Data Analysis and Report

## Overview
This project is based on examining the data regarding usage of bikes for the Citibike company in order to possibly attract investors to create a similar ride-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa.  This analysis uses Tableau to visualize the data for Citibike usage for New York City from August, 2019 as a reference point for how Citibike might be profitable in Des Moines.

## Results
Using Tableau, a number of charts and graphs were created to display the most important factors in considering Citibike as a business, which are who uses the bikesharing service and why they use it.

There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)
There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)

## Summary
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

Links to images are working and displayed correctly. (2 pt)

For this part of the Challenge, youâ€™ll create a story in Tableau and write a report that describes the key outcomes of the NYC Citibike analysis you did in the module and in Deliverable 2.
In Tableau, create a new Story using visualizations that will support the key findings you want to show.

You must use the five visualizations that you created in Deliverable 2.
You must use at least two visualizations that you created in this module.

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)

### Recommendations
Moving forward, future visualizations should focus on data regarding Des Moines, Iowa in order to compare how the usage of Citibike in New York City would be a useful and profitable addition to commerce in Des Moines.

#### Recommendation 1: Commuter Data
Since the Citibike data makes it clear the the majoryity of their usage is for short-distance commuter rides, a map showing the relationships between major places to live within the urban core of Des Moines alongside major areas where people work may indicate the greatest amount of usage within the city.  A map could also be made to show how shorter commutes from suburban neighborhoods might be possible as well.

#### Recommendation 2: Tourist Data
A second visualization would be another map of Des Moines that would consider major attractions and popular restaurants and points of interest within Des Moines to consider how bike routes within the city would be a viable investment and meet a need within the city.
