# Citibike Bikesharing Data Analysis and Report

## Overview
This project is based on examining the data regarding usage of bikes for the Citibike company in order to possibly attract investors to create a similar ride-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa.  This analysis uses Tableau to visualize the data for Citibike usage for New York City from August, 2019 as a reference point for how Citibike might be profitable in Des Moines.

## Results
Using Tableau, a number of charts and graphs were created to display the most important factors in considering Citibike as a business, which are who uses the bikesharing service and why they use it.  

### Visualization 1

The above data is the first look at _who_ the users are for Citibike based on the data that we collected.  The pie chart in the upper left shows that 81% of users are subscribers who regularly use the bikesharing service.  The pie chart in the lower left shows that 25% of users identify as female, 10% are unknown, and 65% of users identify as male.  The line chart at the top right shows how the typical length of a bike ride, showing that the overwhelming number of uses are less than 40 minutes, and the most common length of time for borrowing a bike is 6 minutes.  The line chart at the bottom right breaks down the same data by gender, with all 3 categories following the same trend for duration of using a bike.

### Visualization 2

The bar chart at the top compares the hours at which customers check out a bike, showing the peak hours.  The heat map shows that same information broken down by day in addition to be hour, showing how the usage varies across days of the week, with darker colors representing more usage.

### Visualization 3

The heat map at the top of the chart breaks down the heat map from the second visualization and shows the variance among those identifying as males and females.  The heat map at the bottom of this visualization takes the same information and compares it the users between those who are customers and those who are subscribers and shows their usage across days of the week and time of day.

## Summary
The data shown in the visualizations shows that the overwhelmingly most common use for Citibike is as a means for getting to work.  The evidence to show this is that the majority of the rides are under twnety minutes, which implies that this it is used more commonly for getting somewhere rather than for exercise or sightseeing.  The three most hours for usage are 8am, 5pm, and 6pm, which are common times for commuting to and from work.  The heat map supports this idea as well by showing which that the most common times for usage occur on weekdays with a significant decrease on weekends.  Another piece of evidence is shown below, in which we see that the most common starting and ending points are essentially the same, implying that people are using bikesharing for round trips across one or two stops.

#### Starting Points

#### Ending Points

The data also shows that the bikesharing skews heavily toward usage by those identifying as males, which would be a consideration both for how this company might fit with Des Moines as well as inform how to market the service.

### Recommendations
Moving forward, future visualizations should focus on data regarding Des Moines, Iowa in order to compare how the usage of Citibike in New York City would be a useful and profitable addition to commerce in Des Moines.

#### Recommendation 1: Commuter Data
Since the Citibike data makes it clear the the majoryity of their usage is for short-distance commuter rides, a map showing the relationships between major places to live within the urban core of Des Moines alongside major areas where people work may indicate the greatest amount of usage within the city.  A map could also be made to show how shorter commutes from suburban neighborhoods might be possible as well.

#### Recommendation 2: Tourist Data
A second visualization would be another map of Des Moines that would consider major attractions and popular restaurants and points of interest within Des Moines to consider how bike routes within the city would be a viable investment and meet a need within the city.
